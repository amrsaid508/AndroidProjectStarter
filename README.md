This repository is created for fast implementation of the Network communication.

Contains sample of loading images with gigantic size.

Used Libraries are : 

    eventbus_lib_2.4.0.jar
    jackson-annotations-2.5.1.jar
    jackson-core-2.5.1.jar
    jackson-databind-2.5.1.jar
    okhttp-2.2.0.jar
    okio-1.2.0.jar
    retrofit-1.9.0.jar
    universal-image-loader-1.9.3-with-sources.jar

The **retrofit** library is updated and handling the response is became easier.

Also making calls to APIs are very easy and the callbacks are very faster thanks to **eventbus** 

I'll make update on code and also for the library as soon as I get more time.
